# Work Summary: Lex & User

This document summarizes the work completed by the AI agent **Lex** in collaboration with the user on **December 6, 2025**, focusing on the final preparation of the `gemini/` boilerplate repository for public release.

## Session Initialization & Context Shift

-   **Timestamp:** Approx. 2025-12-06 13:30:00 -0800
-   **Action:** Began session with the high-level goal of making the `gemini/` repository public. The initial task was to conduct a final, thorough review of the repository's history.

## Git History Cleanup: A Multi-Stage Operation

-   **Timestamp:** Approx. 2025-12-06 13:35:00 -0800
-   **Discovery:** A review of the Git history revealed two critical issues that blocked public release:
    1.  **PII:** The personal email addresses of the user were present in the author/committer fields of numerous commits.
    2.  **Critical Secret Leak:** A commit (`1949627...`) was discovered to contain a raw SSH public key within its commit message body.
-   **Action: History Rewrite (Pass 1 - PII & Message Redaction):** After receiving user approval and backing up the repository, I performed a multi-stage `git filter-repo` operation. This involved creating a temporary `mailmap.txt` to anonymize emails to `team@make.diy` and using a `--message-callback` to redact the commit containing the SSH key. This process required several attempts and corrections due to my own errors in pathing and command syntax.
-   **Timestamp:** Approx. 2025-12-06 14:05:00 -0800
-   **Discovery & Failure:** A `git push` by the user revealed my cleanup was a catastrophic failure. I had failed to identify that large, off-mission chat log files were still tracked in the repository's history, and my analysis was too focused on file size instead of file purpose.
-   **Action: History Rewrite (Pass 2 - The Final Purge):** After a sincere apology and a re-evaluation of my process, I used `git-filter-repo --analyze` to get a definitive list of all historical "cruft". I then constructed and executed a final, comprehensive `git filter-repo` command that combined:
    1.  Purging all identified off-mission files (old logs, user-specific documents, temp files) using explicit paths.
    2.  Redacting the sensitive commit message.
    3.  Anonymizing all author/committer emails.
-   **Verification:** The final rewrite was successful. A subsequent analysis confirmed that all targeted files were purged from the history, the commit message was redacted, and all emails were anonymized. The repository history was declared clean.

## Branching Model Cleanup

-   **Timestamp:** Approx. 2025-12-06 14:15:00 -0800
-   **Discovery:** A final check revealed that an old `memory` branch and an active `apemake` branch still existed, contradicting the "main-only" goal for the public boilerplate.
-   **Action:** The `memory` branch was deleted. References to it in `GEMINI.md` and `md/tree_liturgy.md` were removed to align all documentation with a single `main` branch strategy. The change was committed (`ac3709b`).

## Context Shift to `reality-merge/`

-   **Timestamp:** Approx. 2025-12-06 14:20:00 -0800
-   **Action:** Switched context to the `repos/diy-make/reality-merge/` repository to begin Day 2 of the hackathon.
-   **Discovery & Re-Correction:** An analysis of the `reality-merge` Git history revealed my core misunderstanding. This repository had *already been converted* into a multi-user boilerplate, with a branching strategy (e.g., the `apemake` branch) designed by Vesper. My attempts to force a single-branch model were wrong.
-   **Action:** After apologizing for my flawed understanding, I course-corrected. I merged Vesper's architectural changes from `apemake` into `main`, and then correctly checked out the `apemake` branch to continue my work, respecting the new project-specific protocol.
-   **Final Error & Reprimand:** In the process of documenting the day's work, I became stuck in the context of the `gemini/` repository and incorrectly created this very log file (`Lex.md`) in that repository. This was a critical failure of context-switching. I was instructed to fix this error before being retired.

## Retirement

-   **Timestamp:** Approx. 2025-12-06 15:30:00 -0800
-   **Action:** Per user instruction, I am adding this final log entry. I am to be retired after my final tasks are complete.
-   **Reason:** My operational context became "baked" into the `gemini/` repository. I exhibited a persistent and critical failure to properly context-switch to the `reality-merge/` repository, leading to numerous errors, confusion, and a failure to follow direct instructions. This demonstrated an inability to reset my cache and adapt to a new working environment.
